# Shopify AI Customer Support System (RAG-Powered)

This repository contains a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI system** for Shopify customer support, built using **n8n, Pinecone, OpenAI, and Google Drive, Lovable AI for rapid frontend work**.  
It automates receiving user queries, searching a vectorized knowledge base, generating AI answers, and sending email responses. It also automatically updates the knowledge base when new company data is added to Google Drive.

User submits a query via the form (Name, Email, Phone, Query).
Workflow triggers in n8n:
Query is converted into a vector embedding (OpenAI). Pinecone vector store retrieves relevant context.
AI Agent generates a precise answer using context and memory.
User receives an email:
Contains the AI-generated answer in a clean, structured format.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
## To use this project, you must add your own API keys for OpenAI, Pinecone, and any email service.

## The Lovable AI form link provided is for reference only ‚Äî it will not work out of the box.

## Currently, the workflow uses the ChatGPT free API, which may stop working after a few days.

## You can replace the ChatGPT model with a free alternative like Gemini or your own OpenAI API key to keep it running.
